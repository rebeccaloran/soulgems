# Auction House Assets

## Overview
This file contains the **exclusive cards** used in the Auction House module.  
They are divided into four categories:

1. **Relics** – Permanent upgrades.
2. **Terrain/NPC Contracts** – Instant placement or control effects.
3. **Wildcard Spells** – Single-use, high-impact abilities.
4. **Joke Cards** – Silly, sometimes useless, occasionally harmful surprises.

These assets are **only available via Auction House wins** and cannot be earned through normal gameplay.

## Relics
Permanent upgrades that stay with the player for the rest of the game unless removed by specific effects.

| **Crown of the Sun** | All your rolls for movement gain +1 for the rest of the game. |
| **Mirror Blade** | When attacked, roll a die; on 4–6, reflect half the damage back to the attacker. |
| **Soul Compass** | Once per turn, you may re-roll any single die. |
| **Gauntlet of the Titan** | Your melee units gain +1 attack permanently. |
| **Runestone Pendant** | You may store one unused spell each turn for later use. |
| **Shield of Ages** | Once per round, cancel all damage from a single attack against you. |

## Terrain/NPC Contracts
Special contracts that allow immediate creation, placement, or control of terrain or NPC units.

## Wildcard Spells
One-time use cards with immediate or conditional effects.

| Spell | Effect |

| **Chaos Surge** | Both players discard one random relic. |
| **Time Skip** | End the current turn and begin your next turn immediately. |
| **Thief’s Gambit** | Steal 5 currency from your opponent. |
| **Field of Illusions** | Create a fake terrain tile; opponent must roll 4–6 to detect before entering. |

## Joke Cards
These cards are meant to cause laughter, chaos, or mild annoyance. They range from harmless gags to small setbacks.  
**House Rule:** You *must* play a Joke Card immediately upon drawing it.

| Joke Card | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Ancient Sandwich** | No effect, but your hero now insists on carrying it everywhere. |
| **Broken Relic Coupon** | Looks valuable, but expired 400 years ago. |
| **NPC Union Strike** | One of your NPCs refuses to act for 2 turns. |
| **Overenthusiastic Bard** | A bard follows you, loudly narrating your moves. Stealth actions fail automatically until your next turn. |
| **Map of Somewhere Else** | Discard immediately. You just wasted valuable Auction House time. |
| **Suspicious Potion** | Drink immediately. Roll 1d6 — on 1–3, lose 1 unit; on 4–6, gain +1 movement this turn only. |
| **Royal Decree (Incomprehensible)** | Everyone at the table must speak in bad Shakespearean accents until your next turn. No mechanical effect. |
| **Invisible Fortress** | You think you built something great… until you remember invisible walls aren’t real. No effect. |

---
