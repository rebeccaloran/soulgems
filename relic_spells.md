# Soul Gems — Relics & Spells (v0.6 Preview, Expanded)

This is the **expanded** Dominion-style layer for Soul Gems, designed to sit on top of **v0.5** core rules.

- **Relics** = **Permanent Enchantments** (unique, one per card; once claimed, only you have it for the whole game)
- **Spells** = **Instants / Single-Use Tactics** (one-shot effects; then discard)

> **Guardrails from v0.5 (still in force)**
> - Accuracy caps: **min 5% / max 95%**.  
> - Per-attack caps: **+25%** total to-hit, **+2 damage per hit** maximum, and **max one advantage/reroll** on a roll.  
> - Ability activations: **max 2 activations/turn** (Relic *activations* + Spells). Purely passive Relics aren’t counted.  
> - Conversion: **2 SP → 1 LP**, up to **20 SP** converted per turn total.  
> - Gem: **Break 3d6 ≥ 12**, **Repair 3d6 ≥ 10**; no consecutive “repair denial” effects.

## Draft / Market Structure

1) Reveal **8 Relics** (unique). **Snake draft** until each player has **2** Relics.  
2) Reveal **8 Spell piles** (3 copies each). Spells may be bought/used mid-game per card timing.

**Costs notation:**
