# Storyline

The world of Souls persists, shrouded in
darkness. The rulers of this world are known
as Soul Guardians. Their existence hinges
on collecting Soul Gems and storing the
energy emitted by lost souls. Every Guardian
must battle each other, for their very life
is at stake.


Same as standard Chess with changes

## There is no checking the King

	The King can move anywhere it
	normally could without the rule
	of putting itself into check.

## Castling is not a legal move

	This shouldn't be achievable anyway,
	as will be explained in the rules.

	The game ends when the King is captured
 	or if either player reaches 1000 Life Points.

# Equipment
	
	Standard Chess board and pieces

	At least one six-sided die and a 10-sided die

	Pencil/paper or some way to keep both player's LP/SP count

	An area or areas to store pieces(This is your Soul Gem)

	Future versions may implement another area
	similar to the Soul Gem known as The Crypt
	   
	Future versions may implement Ability Cards
	that can be obtained throughout the game under
	various conditions

# Rules

	The game starts with an empty board

	All of your pieces are contained within the Soul Gem, except your King

	Each player takes turns placing their King anywhere
	within their own camp

	Both players roll 3 dice(at the moment only 6-sided)
   	and the player with the highest total chooses who plays
   	white and black. Going second may or may not be a strategic plan.
	
	Both players have Life Points(LP) as well as Soul Points(SP)

	At the start, both players have 20 LP and 0 SP
	
	Unless stated, a player may use points from either pool
	and in any combination between them.

	If after Upkeep the player takes no actions, they may pass
	and receive [(piece value of your army on board) - (pieces value of captured army in enemy soul gem) + (piece value of enemy army captured)] LP 
	capping at a minimum of (10)

	A Player may freely pass to the next phase after any action is taken during any
	phase, but any damage that hasn't resulted in capturing a piece
	will be reset. No points are gained this way and points are not refunded.

# Soul Gems

## Each player has a Soul Gem which stores captured and stolen Souls.

	At the Upkeep of each turn, the total value of
	pieces contained within the player's Soul Gem is
	added together and multiplied by two. This is then
	added to the player's current Soul Points

	Soul Gems may be broken. During a player's Upkeep
	they may spend [(your total captured piece value) - (your captures) + (20)] points from either pool to attempt
	to break it. The player rolls three dice and any roll of
	(6) is added to a total counter. When that counter reaches
	(5) then that player has successfully broken their opponent's Gem. 
	
	The player can no longer summon or gain SP until it is repaired
     
        All of the pieces your opponent has captured are returned to your Soul Gem

	Soul Gems may be repaired. Repair costs (10) LP during Upkeep
	but the roll requirement is (3) counters of either a (1) or (2)

	During Main Phase 2 a player may choose to spend (5) SP and
	roll three dice. Multiply the results of each die together
	and transfer that many points to your LP. If the amount of SP
	is lower than your result, simply transfer all of it.

### Life Points cannot be stolen by another player under any condition.

# Abnilities

## There are abilities that may be used during main phases.

### Soul Steal

	Soul Steal can be used during the first Main Phase only when any of your pieces are directly adjactent one space in any direction around an opponent's.
	
	You may spend [(8) - (Number of pieces adjacent)] each of LP and SP to attempt a Soul Steal. This will 
	capture the piece and place it into your Soul Gem regardless of attack power enemy piece value other than the King. 
	
	Roll (2) 10-sided dies to determine percentage, the first denoting the 100s/10s place and the second denoting the 1s
	
	If the first die die is a 10, you automatically succeed in performing the Soul Steal 

	The Soul Steal will be succesful if you roll any number under and including [20(pieces adhacent)] with a max of (4) pieces 
	then you have performed a successful Soul Steal. 
	
	Otherwise a failure results in that piece being unable to be targetted for attacks/abilities for the remainder of your turn

	It may also be used on your own pieces, but they must be adjacent to your King and you must roll any number up to and including 
	[40(number of pieces adhacent)] with a max of (2) pieces.
	
	Failing a Soul Steal on your own piece prevents that piece from moving or attacking for the remainder of the turn.

### Summon removes one of your own pieces from your Soul Gem and places 
it on its starting square. Either starting square counts but it must
be unoccupied. This costs [(piece) + (5)]

	Can only be used during Upkeep

	You may pay an additional point each [(x) + (y)]
	placement of the piece. For example, to place a White Queen 
	from your Soul Gem to the h3 square, you pay [(9) + (5)]
	which would place it on d1, then pay [(4) + (2)] which
	costs (20) points total.

	Pieces may only be placed within the first four ranks(your camp)
	
	If a piece is occupying that square, you must use the other square as a starting point
	and if both squares are occupied then you may not summon that piece
	
	Logically the same can be said for the target square if distance is added

### Teleport is the same as Summon but only for pieces on the board

	Can only be used during End Phase

# Promotion

	A pawn can promote as normal

	A promoted pawn is permantly that piece and will
	act the same way as any starting piece on or off the board
	
	A new pawn is added to your Soul Gem

# Movement

### Movement can only be done during Main Phase 1 or 2

	Movement and capturing happen separately

	The cost to move a piece is [(piece) + (distance)]

	(distance) can only be a maximum of the pieces' traditional
	legal move distance.

	Knights can move any number of times to empty squares.
	The Knight costs (3) per jump.

# Capturing

### Capturing a piece requires at least one piece that can target
   an enemy piece. In order to capture it you must deal a total 
   amount of damage equal to the piece and there are accuracy rolls of 2 10-sided dice

	Attacking costs [2(piece) + (distance)]

	For example, attacking a Queen on d7 with a Rook on d1, a Knight
	on e5, and a Pawn on e6 would cost: 
	[2(5) + (6)] + [2(3) + (3)] + [2(1) + (1)]
		
		= [16] + [9] + [3]
		
		= 28 Points

	Capturing a piece adds [5(piece)] to your LP


### The King is a direct link to the Soul Guardian, a God. 

	A King can only be defeated by converting it to a new Soul Gem. 
	
	This takes inflicting a total of (20) damage
	
	Roll (2) 10-sided dice
	
	A (10) on the first die counts as a success
	
	You need to have a result under and including [10(number of pieces adjacent)] with a max of (8)
