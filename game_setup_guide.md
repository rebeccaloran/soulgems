# Game Setup Guide (Core + Modular Rules)

This guide explains how to set up the game using **only a standard chess set** (plus common household objects) while supporting all core and modular systems: Relics, Field Building, NPCs, and Terrain.

---

## 1. Core Components Needed

- **Standard Chess Set** (one black set, one white set)
- **Optional Third Color** (for NPC pieces or neutral units — can use checkers, coins, or any distinguishable tokens)
- **Notebook or Parchment Paper** (for field drawing if using Field Building module)
- **Markers or Poker Chips** (color-coded for weather, terrain, or NPC effects)
- **Flat Objects** (like dominoes, tiles, or Settlers of Catan pieces for walls/bridges)

---

## 2. Default Board Setup

- Use an **8×8 chessboard** for Core rules.
- White side at bottom, Black side at top.
- Core piece arrangement follows the standard chess setup unless otherwise modified by Relics or Scenario rules.

## 3. Modular Expansions

### 3.1 Relic Module
- Shuffle Relic cards and draft according to the Relic drafting rules before the game begins.
- Players keep their Relics hidden until played (unless the Relic specifies otherwise).

### 3.2 Field Building Module
- Starting with the base 8×8 board, players alternately **add one tile at a time** to expand the battlefield.
- Field size can expand up to an additional 32 squares for a max of **10×10** in core rules, or up to **32×32** in Extended Campaign mode.
- Record all changes on parchment or a notepad using the **Universal Board Key** (see Section 5).

### 3.3 NPC Module
- NPC pieces use the third color.
- NPC actions occur in the NPC Phase:
  - In 1v1 games: The opposing player controls NPC actions during your upkeep and end phase.
  - In team/campaign games: NPC actions are voted on by the designated NPC team.

### 3.4 Terrain & Weather Module
- Terrain markers (poker chips, tokens) indicate specific terrain effects.
- Weather effects can be represented by cards or tokens placed on the field.
- All terrain and weather changes affect **both players** equally.
