This is a **fast reference** to get you playing Soul Gems without reading the full rulebook.  
For full rules, see: `readme.md`

## Objective
Defeat your opponent by:
- Dealing **20 damage to their King**, **or**
- Forcing them into a position where they cannot take their turn.

---

## Setup
1. **Board**: Standard chessboard setup.
2. **Pieces**: Use standard chess pieces and their starting positions.
3. **Stats**:
   - **LP (Life Points)**: Start at 20.
   - **SP (Soul Points)**: Start at 0.
4. **Ability Draft**:
   - Shuffle the **Permanent Enchantment** and **Single Use** ability decks together.
   - Each player drafts 1 permanent enchantment at the start.
   - Shuffle the single-use cards into a shared deck.

---

## Piece Values
- Pawn = 1
- Knight = 3
- Bishop = 3
- Rook = 5
- Queen = 9
- King = Special (cannot be removed from board, only damaged)

---

## Turn Sequence
1. **Upkeep Phase**
   - Resolve any ongoing effects from abilities.
2. **Main Phase**
   - Summon captured pieces back to the board (costs LP).
   - Play a single-use ability card.
3. **Battle Phase**
   - Declare attacks with any number of pieces.
   - Pay **Attack Cost** and roll for accuracy.
4. **End Phase**
   - Convert SP to LP if desired (2 SP = 1 LP).

---

## Combat Rules

### Attack Cost
**[ 2 × (Attacker Value) + Distance in squares ]**  
Example: Rook (5) attacking 6 squares away = 2×5 + 6 = **16 SP**

### Accuracy Roll
Roll **two d10s** (first = tens digit, second = ones digit) to make a d100.  
- A **10** on the first die is an **automatic hit**.
- Otherwise:  
  Hit if result ≤ **20 + [10 × (Attacker Value – Defender Value)]**

### Damage
- Capturing a piece deals damage equal to **its piece value**.
- Capturing **adds** `5 × captured piece value` SP to the attacker.

---

## Winning
- Reduce opponent’s King HP to **0** (20 damage total).
- Or they cannot take their turn due to lack of LP/SP/pieces.

---

## Tips for New Players
- Balance **SP spending** between attacking and restoring LP.
- Draft permanent enchantments that match your playstyle.
- Early captures snowball into more SP — don’t ignore small pieces.
