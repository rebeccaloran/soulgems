# Auction House Module

## Overview
The Auction House is an **optional module** that triggers **every 20 turns** in a 1v1 game (10 turns each).  
It adds a high-stakes layer of economy and bluffing, allowing players to bid for **exclusive rewards** that cannot be earned through standard gameplay.

The system blends elements of **Texas Hold’em poker** bluffing, **bidding wars**, and strategic currency management.

## Currency & Betting Rules

### Currency
- **Currency** is tracked using poker chips, coins, or simple written numbers.
- Players start with **0 currency**.
- Currency is earned by completing **personal objectives** (see below).

### Bidding System
- Bids can be any number in **agreed increments** (recommended: 1, 10, 15, 20, 25, …).
- On a player's turn to act in the auction, they may:
  - **Raise**: Increase the current bid.
  - **Call**: Match the current highest bid.
  - **Fold**: Exit the round and **lose all currency bid so far**.
- The highest remaining bidder at the end wins the Auction House reward.
- If all but one player folds, the last remaining player wins immediately.

### Poker-Style Risk
- If a player **folds**, they forfeit the currency committed to that auction round.
- If a player wins, they pay their winning bid in currency and receive the reward card.

---

## Timing
- The Auction House phase occurs **every 20 turns**.
- The **reward card** is revealed **before bidding begins**.
- Players may strategize based on the revealed reward, their current currency, and their assessment of the opponent’s intentions.

---

## Deck Setup
- Shuffle all Auction House cards into one deck, or keep separate piles for each category.
- At each Auction House phase, **reveal the top card** before bidding begins.
- Once drawn, a card is removed from the game unless otherwise specified.

---

## Strategy Notes
- Saving currency for later rounds can secure more impactful rewards—but doing so risks letting your opponent gain powerful advantages early.
- Folding too often conserves currency but may leave you without key abilities.
- Some rewards are situational; winning them at the right time can swing the game.
